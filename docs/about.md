title: About
description: I was born in 1988. I live in India and a small town kid.i am highly
  competative, open for challanges , eager to learn           new things from any
  one anything constructive. I’ve been a professional developer for more than 7 years.           I’ve
  mostly worked professionally with .Net stack, client side technologies but also
  a little bit with Python.           I’ve published couple of articles.           I
  like building new stuff and work with other people – nothing really interesting
  is ever built alone!
